            <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
            <p><strong>Last updated: October 25, 2025</strong></p>

            <p>Earnings Review Nexus is an affiliate marketing review website. This means we partner with companies to promote their products and services. This disclosure is intended to inform you, our valued reader, about the nature of our business model.</p>

            <h2>What is an Affiliate Link?</h2>
            <p>An affiliate link is a special URL that contains an identifying code. When you click on one of these links and proceed to make a purchase, we may receive a small commission from the sale, at no extra cost to you.</p>

            <h2>Why We Use Affiliate Links</h2>
            <p>Operating a website and conducting thorough research for reviews involves significant time and resources. The commissions earned through affiliate links are what allow us to maintain this site, keep the content free for you, and continue to provide honest, in-depth, and unbiased reviews.</p>

            <h2>Our Commitment to Integrity</h2>
            <p>Our editorial integrity is our highest priority. The presence of an affiliate relationship **never** influences the content, topics, reviews, or ratings we publish. We only recommend products that we genuinely believe offer high value to our audience and that we have thoroughly analyzed or tested.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Unbiased Reviews:</strong> Our reviews are based on our own analysis, user data, and real-world testing.</li>
                <li><strong>No Extra Cost:</strong> Using our affiliate links does not increase the price you pay; in fact, we sometimes secure special offers or discounts for our readers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By clicking on an affiliate link and purchasing a product, you are supporting our work and helping us keep Earnings Review Nexus running. We sincerely appreciate your support!</p>

            <p>If you have any questions regarding this disclosure, please refer to our <a href="/en/contact.html">Contact Page</a>.</p>
