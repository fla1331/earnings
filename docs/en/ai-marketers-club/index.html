        <li><strong>Subscription Cost:</strong> Being a membership-based platform, it involves an ongoing cost, which might be a consideration for those on a tight budget.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliance on External Tools:</strong> While it curates tools, members still need to understand and potentially subscribe to various third-party AI tools for full functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Not a "Done-For-You" Service:</strong> It provides guidance and tools, but the execution and strategy remain with the marketer.</li>
      </ul>
